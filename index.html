        <p class=about-me>
        I am brand new to coding. After spending five years in the Real Estate/Title Insurance realm, I decided to try
        something totally different and very much outside of my comfort zone. My desire to learn coding is because I would like
        to have a better handle on technology and to have a concrete skill set to market myself with. I also enjoy that coding
        allows me to express my creative side. </p>
        <p>
        I'm originally from Michigan and though I've lived in Colorado for 2/3's of my life, I'll always be a fan of my
        Michigan sports teams (no matter how bad they get). When I'm not learning coding or watching sports, I'm an avid reader,
        enjoy baking, and have a three year old golden retriever. I also really enjoy traveling. I've grown up spending time in
        the Cayman Islands, made it to Canada a few times and have also visited Italy and New Zealand.
